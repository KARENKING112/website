      <title>Google Docs originality reports are broken</title>

      <description>Plagiarism is taking someone&amp;rsquo;s work and saying it&amp;rsquo;s yours.
 Background Google Classroom has a feature called &amp;ldquo;originality reports&amp;rdquo; which will scan student work in the form of Google Docs for content that was plagiarised from placed on the internet.
Read more about it here.
Testing it out I like to tinker with things and see how they work, and thus how they can be improved. So naturally, when one of my teachers gave me an assignment in Google Classroom with originality reports enabled, I immediately wanted to see if I could get past it.</description>

      <title>Having School on Festivus is Evil</title>
      <link>https://asineth.me/festivus-school/</link>

      <description>Look at this young boy being oppressed during Festivus.
 The issue In many public schools across the United States, children are being forced against their will, to attend school on the day of Festivus. This is a tragic event, that so many students&#39; holiday traditions on Festivus are being impeded and oppressed by the public school system. They&amp;rsquo;re fine with giving these same children Christmas off, so they can go consume and purchase commerical goods, but they don&amp;rsquo;t want them to celebrate Festivus, they don&amp;rsquo;t want them questioning the holiday they&amp;rsquo;re told to celebrate.</description>

      <title>Using an Android as a SBC/Pi alternative</title>
      <link>https://asineth.me/phone-server/</link>

      <description>Motivation I have old Android phones lying around and wanted to host a Minecraft server for friends. I initially thought of buying an SBC such as Pi or ODROID, instead I though to try and use an old phone instead.
How My setup works by configuring an SSH server, a chroot with a Linux distro that supports aarch64, and configuring init scripts so that Android&amp;rsquo;s system UI gets stopped and doesn&amp;rsquo;t take up resources.</description>

      <title>Debian 10 Root on Encrypted ZFS</title>
      <link>https://asineth.me/debian-zfs/</link>

      <description>Motivation Why would you want to use ZFS as your root filesystem?
 Snapshots and rollbacks Send incremental snapshots over the network Datasets (i.e. /home, /var, /tmp) Copy-on-write architecture Compression to save space Checksums for data integrity, auto-repair Built-in native encryption Flexible configuration per dataset  Context ZFS is awesome, why isn&amp;rsquo;t it the default filesystem? Well, it mainly stems from one thing, and that&amp;rsquo;s licensing. ZFS is licensed under the CDDL, and the Linux kenrel is licensed under the GPL.</description>
