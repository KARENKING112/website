  <h1>Having School on Festivus is Evil</h1>
  <p><img src="/festivus.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Look at this young boy being oppressed during Festivus.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-issue">The issue</h2>
<p>In many public schools across the United States, children are being forced against their
will, to attend school on the day of Festivus. This is a tragic event, that so many
students' holiday traditions on Festivus are being impeded and oppressed by the public
school system. They&rsquo;re fine with giving these same children Christmas off, so they can
go consume and purchase commerical goods, but they don&rsquo;t want them to celebrate Festivus,
they don&rsquo;t want them questioning the holiday they&rsquo;re told to celebrate.</p>
<p>For those who are unaware, Festivus is a secular holiday, that is observed and celebrated
on the 23rd of December each and every year. It comes along with many different
traditions like gathering around an aluminum pole and taking turns complaining around the
beloved dinner table.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, this year, and for many that have come before it, our children won&rsquo;t
be able to have the full day to celebrate. It&rsquo;s a shame really, how we&rsquo;ve let our system
come to this. I honestly find it disgraceful and revolting how the public school system
thinks this is culturally or morally acceptable. I hope they find it in their hearts to
reconsider their ways, but I believe I know their motivations; they work for the man
known as Saint Nicholas. Sometimes he is also referred to as &ldquo;Santa Claus.&rdquo;</p>

<p><img src="/santa.jpg" alt=""></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As you can see, he&rsquo;s clearly up to no good.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Santa is in kahoots with the government and the public schools. It is evident by the way
they distribute the time they give the children every year for holiday break. The reason
they do this is so that it is more conveienet for parents to celebrate Christmas, and
they won&rsquo;t want to risk their attendence to truly celebrate Festivus. So what are Santa&rsquo;s
motivations? Why is he doing this?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s simple, really. It&rsquo;s all about the economy. Santa and the government thrive off of
Christmas consumerism, everyone buying gifts for one another, trees that will fall apart
in a matter of months, and things like greeting cards. It&rsquo;s all a scheme to profit off
of the &ldquo;holiday spirit&rdquo; that we teach our kids to believe in.</p>
<p>When he&rsquo;s not manipulating children or trying to get people to spend their hard earned
money, he&rsquo;s enslaving elves or spying on children. The spying in fact, is a direct
violation of COPPA and related privacy laws designed to protect children from spying and
data collection.</p>

<p>Festivus is the holiday for the rest of us. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what walk of life you are
from, or what religion (if any) that you believe in. Here&rsquo;s some common traditions that
are obsereved on the holiday that is Festivus.</p>
<p>At the dinner table, immediately following the complettion of the dinner, the first and
main attraction will commence. This is known as &ldquo;The Airing of the Grievances,&rdquo; and is
a time for everyone to decompress and have some meaningful conversation. The dialogue
consists of everyone taking turns, complaining about everyone in their lives and how
this year managed to disappoint them (yet again).</p>
<p>Following this inspriational discourse, is the &ldquo;The Feats of Strength,&rdquo; where the host
will choose who will be participating. A person is allowed to decline, should they have
something better to do. If they cannot participate though, they should pick another to
participate in their place. They will all then remove and bulky clothing and chanting,
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s Rumble!&rdquo; They will then wrestle until the host is pinned. Only then, is the
holiday officially declared over.</p>
<p>Beyond that, another fun thing to consider: any coincidental event or occurence should
be referred to as a &ldquo;Festivus miracle&rdquo; regardless of whether that even really makes
any sense or not.</p>

<p>If you despise this oppressionistic practice perpetrated by the public school system as
much as I do, please, sign this petition. Realistically, this will do absolutely nothing,
but it will make us feel a little bit better, and maybe (just maybe) we can get on the
news or something.</p>
